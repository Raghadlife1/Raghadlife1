README: Weather Information App

Overview
This Weather Information App allows users to retrieve real-time weather data for any city worldwide. It leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to provide current temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and more. The app is simple, user-friendly, and built using Java Swing for the graphical user interface, focusing on essential concepts like API integration and GUI development.

Technical Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later
  - [Download JDK here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html).
- OpenWeatherMap API Key
  - [Register for a free API key here](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up).
- Internet connection
  - A stable internet connection is required to fetch weather data from the API.

Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository or download the project ZIP file.
2. Open the project in any IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Generate an API key from OpenWeatherMap and paste it into the relevant section of the code.
4. Compile and run the project using your IDE or the terminal:
   bash
   javac WeatherApp.java
   java WeatherApp
   

Usage
1. Launch the application.
2. Enter the name of a city in the search bar.
3. Click the Get Weather button.
4. The application will display the current weather information, including temperature, humidity, and a short weather description.
5. To search for another city, repeat the process.

Implementation Details
- WeatherApp.java:  Main class to launch the application.
- WeatherService.java:  Handles API requests and JSON parsing.
- UIController.java: Manages the user interface and event handling using Java Swing.


Troubleshooting

If the application doesnâ€™t retrieve weather data:
- Verify your internet connection.
- Make sure the API key is valid and correctly entered.
- Check the spelling of the city name.


Potential Improvements
- Add support for multiple languages.
- Implement a forecast feature to display weather for the next 7 days.
- Provide error messages for invalid city names or network issues.
